<h4>Title: Batwing Horse</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <img src="Images/Showcase/imgshow1.jpg" alt="Drawing Of Horse">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p> Winged horses is a normal concept. <br>
            The idea has existed within roman mythology with "Pegasus". However I wanted to change the wings and see what would it look like. </p>

<h4>Title: Happy White Fox</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I like foxes. They are one of my favourt animals. <br> 
        So I wanted to challenge myself to try capture a white snow fox. This was a challenge as I wanted to keep the pencil light as possible.</p>

<h4>Title: Red Squirrel in Nature</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <img src="Images/Showcase/imgshow3.jpg" alt="Squirrel With Nut">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The red squirrel are sneaky. <br>
        This is a sketch of one that I saw in nature before I took a photo to draw after. This was the perfect picture to test fur as I've never tried to do it before. <br>
        This became one of my favourt drawings. It was fun and entertaining to do.</p>

<h4>Title: Flowers of all</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This one was tricky. Believe it or not this was the first painting I've done. <br>
        The goal was to throw together a bunch of plants. <br>
        My goal was not the logic of what should be in but mainly how to paint it. <br>
        I will admit this turn out well and took nearly a month to do. <br>
        Oh, This was done with acrylic paints.</p>

<h4>Title: Chibi School Boy</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <img src="Images/Showcase/imgshow5.jpg" alt="Chibi Drawing">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This is one of the earliest drawings I made. This was done at school during free time. <br> 
        The reason I'm showing this one is to show that your work can change depending on how long you develop your skills. <br> <br>
        Chibi is the style of drawing. It's originally a style of Japan "Anime" or "Manga" which are detailed humoid drawings of people and characters. Chibi is a short cute style of that style. <br> <br>
        I've not done this style of drawing for 10 years however I still like the cute style it gives off.

<h4>Title: Buddha Pointillism</h4>
<div class="imgshow">
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Another style. Pointillism. This means a drawing done with only dotes and no lines. <br> <br>
        It a very difficult style to do as without doing lines it can take a very long time to do, about 3 times longer. <br> <br>
        Even though it took along time. This is a unquie style that pleasing to look at.</p>
