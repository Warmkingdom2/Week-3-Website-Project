<h1>About me</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Who am I? These are always tough questions to answer. <br> <br>
    I'm James. <br>
    I would say I'm a creative person who enjoy making entertainment and drawings for others to enjoy. My goal in life is to gain all the knowalage I need to creative a entertaining game to leave behind for people to enjoy. <br> <br>
    Art is something I do, mainly for fun but am self taught. Because I am self taught, I always make mistakes when learning new styles or mediums as I learned it differently to how others do it. <br> 
    This makes it take longer to do some easy stuff but it the way I enjoy doing it. <br><br>
    Currently I'm learning coding. I hope in learning these skills will help me expand my skills to my goal in life and working life. <br>
    You can see how thats going with this current page as it was coded by me. <br><br>
    That mainly me. Thank you for looking at my website.
