<h1>Welcome to my Art Blog</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>This website is dedicated to the many years of work done with artwork I've done. <br><br> Feel free to browse at my work and content. Each work piece has a history or feeling I was having as I worked on it. <br><br> Some do have mistakes. But that is the nature of life. We learn from said mistakes and think how to improve onto the next. <br><br> Many times we draw a piece of work. It may look ugly while unfinished and want to redo or scrap it. Don't. Always finish the work. You never know what you may expect. It could be the next masterpiece of your work.</p>
